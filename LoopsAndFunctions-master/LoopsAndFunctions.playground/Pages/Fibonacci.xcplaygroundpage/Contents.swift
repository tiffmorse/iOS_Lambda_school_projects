 ## Fibonacci
 
 Write a function that takes an integer called `n`. The function should return the _nth_ number in the Fibonacci sequence. Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the previous two numbers together. The sequence always starts with 1, 1. For example, the first ten numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55`. So, if you called your function with an argument of `6`, it should return 8. Call your function with several different values for `n` and verify that it returns the correct numbers.

 ## Bonus: Recursive Fibonacci
 
 It's actually possible for a function to call _itself_. When a function calls itself, it's called _recursion_. Recursion can be a useful technique in a number of situations, but especially when the same steps have to be performed over and over and the results from a previous step are required to complete the current one. Calculating the Fibonacci sequence lends itself very well to a recursive solution.
 
 See if you can rewrite the function above so that it uses recursion, that is so that it calls itself. Call your function with several different values for `n` and verify that it still returns the correct numbers.
 
 > This is intentionally a pretty difficult problem, and recursion is an advanced technique that nearly everyone finds difficult when they first learn about it. Don't worry if you don't get it. It's a good way to push yourself, but it's not a skill you actually need to use when you're just starting out.
 >
 > Hints:
 >   - Remember that the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are both 1. If your function is called with an argument of 1 or 2, it should return 1.
 >   - It may be helpful to look at the mathematical formula for the nth number in the sequence, which is `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`.

 ## Bonus 2: Fibonacci App
 
 Create an app in Xcode that has a single text field, a button, and text view. The text field should allow the user to enter a number. When the button is tapped, the app should calculate the first _n_ values in the Fibonacci sequence and put them in the text view, separated by commas. N here (the number of values to print) is the number the user entered into the text field.
 
 Test the app to make sure it prints the correct sequences. Try it with a somewhat large number in the text field, like `40`. What happens?
