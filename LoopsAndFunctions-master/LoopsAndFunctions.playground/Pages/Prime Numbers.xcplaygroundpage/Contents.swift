/*:
 ## Prime Numbers
 
 Write a function called `printPrimes(upTo n: Int)`. The function should print the prime numbers that are between 1 and `n`. A number is prime if it is only evenly divisible by itself and 1, and not evenly divisible by any other number. Call your function with several different values for `n` and verify that it prints the correct numbers.
 
 */

/*
 Rewrite the above function so that it's two functions. One called `printPrimes(upTo n: Int)` and the other called `isPrime(_ x: Int) -> Bool`. `isPrime()` should return true if the passed in number is prime, false otherwise. `printPrimes()` should do the same thing as before, but should call `isPrime()` to check if each number is prime.
